# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-And-Visualization

This project aims to develop a MATLAB program for processing and visualizing COVID-19 pandemic data. The program loads COVID-19 data into a cell array named "covid_data," where each cell holds a 2-element vector representing cumulative case count and deaths for a specific country and date.

To organize the data, our program creates objects for each country and state. States are grouped under their respective countries. We can achieve this by either storing countries in a vector of country objects within the app or using a single global object to hold all countries.
